# bootcamp-challenge-1-code-refactor

## Description

In this code refactor, I simplified and reorganized the HTML and CSS of the Horiseon Social Solution Services' home page. The overall goal was to overall improve the webpage in fuctionality (through fixing bugs like the SEO nav button not directing anywhere), accessability and SEO (by adding accessability attributes), and developer organization (through simlpfying, restructuring, and providing detailed comments in the HTML and CSS). 

The main learings I gained from this project were: 
- A deeper understanding of different CSS elements and their attributes.
- Ways to simplify code to make it easier to digest and edit in the future (i.e. making it so when you adjust the h2 CSS it applies to all h2 elements.)
- How to organize your code in a clear way for the benifit of yourself and any other developers that work on the page.
